# Day 00

## [midLS](./midLS)

In a midLS file,  
place the command line  
that will list all files and directories  
in your current directory  
(except for hidden files  
or any file that start by a dot  
-yes, that includes double-dots),  
separated by a comma,  
by order of creation date.  
Make sure directories’ names  
are followed by a slash character.

---

## [Z](./z)

Create a file called z that returns "Z",  
followed by a new line,  
whenever the command cat is used on it.

---

## [clean](./clean)

In a file called clean  
place the command line  
that will search for all files  
-in the current directory  
as well as in its sub-directories-  
ending by ~,  
and/or all files that start or end by #.  

The command line will show  
and erase all files found.  

Only one command is allowed:  
no ’;’ or ’&&’ or other shenanigans.
